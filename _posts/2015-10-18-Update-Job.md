I finally change my job
=======================

now happier. 

- easy to go
- skating
- ....

code:

~~~c
   if(true)
      printf("hello world");
~~~


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
